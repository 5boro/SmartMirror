# Group Project [BSCO-GP/Dub/FT]

Smart Mirror project, where we want to place a computer screen behind a mirror, to have users interact with it through VOCAL and visual sensors and display information from the user's social media accounts, news or weather and a clock.

The project will need a client(mirror/raspberry pi) and server(website and API)

We will have to build a website, and have the raspberry pi boot directly into a web browser in full screen and display the web page.
The raspberry pi will also have to continuously check for faces, if the face is recognised it will signal it to the server through the API, AND SAME THING FOR THE VOICE COMMANDS.
